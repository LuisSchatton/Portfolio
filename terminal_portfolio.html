    <h1>About this Portfolio</h1>

    <div class="hidden" id="c_text">
        With this portfolio, I wanted to push myself and my abilities to create something new. Since my passion lies in
        the field of emerging technologies and design, I wanted to explore the idea of virtual space. As a big fan of
        Neal Stephensons ‘Snow Crash’, I always wanted to build my own little space on the internet.

        The website is built in three.js, without the help of any external plugins. The rudimentary physics engine is
        completely self-made, with inspiration from the three.js guide and help from my friend (thank you, Yannick!).
        All 3D assets and most textures are also self-made, mostly ripped from their corresponding project files. The
        skybox was kindly provided by Jockum Skoglund.

    <div class="hidden" id="c_link2">
        To bring it all together, I made a second Version of this space in Blender and baked the more realistic lighting
        achievable there to all the textures. This brings greater performance for the Desktop. There are still many
        things I want to do with this site, but hopefully it was still a fun experience for you!
