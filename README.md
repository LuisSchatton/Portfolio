# First portfolio

My first portfolio was made completely using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). It consists of a walkable 3D Plane decorated using some of my early 3D models. The models also make up interactive elements, allowing the user to look at my different university projects.

The user is able to navigate using the classic "WASD" control scheme, which is combined with a rudimentary, self-written physics engine using ray-caster objects to allow the user to navigate the scene.

To achieve the semi-realistic lighting, reflections and shadows the scene was also built in blender, with the pre-calculated lighting rendered onto the textures, to allow for a better performance on lower-end hardware.
